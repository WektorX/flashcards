# Speech

School project - an application written in Angular for learning vocabulary. Get the vocabulary with PHP from the XML file. The application uses SpeechSynthesis in order to blur text to speech so that the user learns correct pronunciation while learning. There is also an administrator panel for editing / removing / adding vocabulary or lessons - the xml file is updated on a regular basis after making any changes. This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.6.
